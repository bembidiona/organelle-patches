# Drawave
Drawave is a wavetable synthesizer, in witch you can draw and mutate your own wave.

## FEATURES/NOTES:
- You can scroll and zoom in/out.
- The resolution of the waveform is resampled no matter the zoom level, so if you see a triangle you hear a triangle, even if itâ€™s constructed of only three points.
- Options to mutate the wavetable, xenakis style (?). Give some interesting rhythmic jams.
