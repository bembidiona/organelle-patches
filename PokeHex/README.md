# PokeHex
Cursed Pokedex for cry mangling.\
At its core itâ€™s a granular synthesizer with double header.

## FEATURES/NOTES:
- Change speed and pitch independently of each other.
- Reverse playback, and and set In and Out markers.
- 6 voice poly (super easy to add more if you need it).
- Damp pedal drop an octave, even of the currently hold keys.
- All original 151 pokemon sprites demaked for 1 bit graphics with lots of care.

- I end up going for the updated cries. There are way more unique and interesting to mangle that the GB originals. Sorry genwunners.
