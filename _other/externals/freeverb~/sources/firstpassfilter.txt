Part of the freeverb design is a comb filter which consists of a delay buffer and a filter section. 
The incoming audio is delayed and send to both the filter and the output. The filter output is fed 
to both the delay buffer and the filter input. This means the first reflected signal is not filtered, 
only the later reflections. The result is a clear reverb, characteristic of freeverb.

The [firstpassfilter 1( message switches from the traditional output to a filtered outlet, having all 
reflections pass through the filter. The effect is quite distinct for high [damping( values.
