## FEATURES/NOTES:
– Transpose, chorus and reberb effects before the looper. Also added a properly working damp pedal.
– Ships with instruments from Mother 3, Yoshi’s Island, a bunch of ‘world’ instruments and an Argentinian Bandoneon. If you want more soundfonts a good place to search is [this](https://musical-artifacts.com/artifacts?formats=sf2).
– Added a python script to ease create the txt files from where the player reads all available instruments and files. Just drop the sf2 files you want to the sf2/ folder and run the script.
