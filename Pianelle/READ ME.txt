	HOW TO ADD MORE SONGS
------------------------------------
- First of, I wanted to stay vanilla, so I went the route of reading text files instead of directly from midi files. This conversion processes is done on a PC/MAC/LINUX computer. (maybe python can be runed on the organelle, but idkh) 
- Add the midi files you want to src/midi/ folder
- Run src/parseMidi.py (you need to have installed Python and the mido module: https://pypi.org/project/mido/ )
- The converted midi files will be automatically placed on the miditxt/ folder
- Copy the new .txt files (including list.txt) to the miditxt/ folder on the Organelle patch.

Notes:
- The /src folder it just to convert the midi files to the txt files that will be read by PureData. It's not used by the patch on the Organelle in any way, so you don't need to copy it.
- The recommended range of keys is from C4 to B5. Lower and higher notes will be automatically remapped though.
